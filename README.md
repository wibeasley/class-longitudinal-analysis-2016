### Course Description

This course will cover the modern statistical approaches to the analysis of longitudinal data, i.e., data collected repeatedly on experimental units over time (or other conditions). Topics include mixed effects models, ANOVA and MANOVA approaches to longitudinal data, covariance pattern models, generalized estimating equations, computational issues, and missing data in longitudinal studies
The main topics covered are:

1. Introduction to longitudinal data analysis
2. ANOVA and MANOVA approaches to longitudinal data analysis
4. Covariance pattern models
3. Mixed-Effects models for continuous, binary, ordinal, nominal, and count outcomes
4. Generalized Estimating Equations Models including GLM and GEE and time dependent covariates
5. Missing data in longitudinal studies
6. Cross-sectional and intra-individual strategies
7. Goals: Prediction vs theory building
